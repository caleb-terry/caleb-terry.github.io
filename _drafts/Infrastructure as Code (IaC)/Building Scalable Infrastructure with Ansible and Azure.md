# Building Scalable Infrastructure with Ansible and Azure

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that can help you build and manage scalable infrastructure on Azure. This guide covers the basics of using Ansible with Azure to automate your infrastructure deployment and management.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure account
- Basic understanding of Ansible and Azure services
- Ansible installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Install Azure Modules for Ansible

1. Install the `azure.azcollection` collection:
   ```sh
   ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection
   ```
2. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   ansible-galaxy collection list | grep azure.azcollection
   ```

## Step 2: Configure Azure Credentials

1. Create a service principal in Azure:
   ```sh
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name AnsibleServicePrincipal --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>
   ```
2. Set the environment variables with the service principal details:
   ```sh
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<appId>
   export AZURE_SECRET=<password>
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscriptionId>
   export AZURE_TENANT=<tenant>
   ```

## Step 3: Create an Ansible Playbook

1. Create a new playbook file (`azure_infrastructure.yml`):

   ```yaml
   - name: Create Azure Resources
     hosts: localhost
     tasks:
       - name: Create a resource group
         azure.azcollection.azure_rm_resourcegroup:
           name: myResourceGroup
           location: eastus

       - name: Create a virtual network
         azure.azcollection.azure_rm_virtualnetwork:
           resource_group: myResourceGroup
           name: myVnet
           address_prefixes: 10.0.0.0/16

       - name: Create a subnet
         azure.azcollection.azure_rm_subnet:
           resource_group: myResourceGroup
           virtual_network: myVnet
           name: mySubnet
           address_prefix: 10.0.1.0/24
   ```

## Step 4: Run the Playbook

1. Execute the playbook to create the Azure resources:
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook azure_infrastructure.yml
   ```

## Step 5: Verify the Deployment

1. Log in to the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to `Resource groups` and verify the creation of `myResourceGroup` with the specified resources.

## Summary

Ansible provides a powerful and flexible way to automate the deployment and management of Azure infrastructure. By following these steps, you can quickly set up scalable and repeatable infrastructure on Azure.
