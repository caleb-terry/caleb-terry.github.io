# Mastering Azure DevOps Pipelines: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Azure DevOps Pipelines are a crucial component in the DevOps lifecycle, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your applications. This guide will walk you through setting up your first Azure DevOps Pipeline, from creating a new project to deploying your application.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure DevOps account
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD concepts
- A sample application to deploy (we’ll use a simple web app for this example)

## Step 1: Create a New Project in Azure DevOps

1. Log in to your Azure DevOps account.
2. Click on `New Project`.
3. Enter a project name and description.
4. Set the visibility (public or private) and click `Create`.

## Step 2: Set Up Repositories

1. Navigate to the `Repos` section in your newly created project.
2. Initialize a new repository or import your existing repository.
3. Ensure your code is pushed to this repository.

## Step 3: Create a New Pipeline

1. Go to the `Pipelines` section.
2. Click `New pipeline`.
3. Select the source of your code (e.g., Azure Repos Git, GitHub).
4. Choose the repository that contains your application.

## Step 4: Configure Your Pipeline

1. Use the YAML editor to define your pipeline. Here’s a basic example:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     - main

   pool:
     vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

   steps:
     - task: UseDotNet@2
       inputs:
         packageType: "sdk"
         version: "5.x"
         installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

     - script: dotnet build --configuration Release
       displayName: "Build project"

     - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
       inputs:
         PathtoPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
         ArtifactName: "drop"
   ```

2. Save and run the pipeline.

## Step 5: Deploy Your Application

1. After the build completes, navigate to the `Releases` section.
2. Click `New pipeline` and select your build artifact.
3. Define the stages (e.g., Dev, Test, Production) and configure the deployment steps.
4. Save and create the release.

## Summary

You’ve now set up a basic Azure DevOps Pipeline that builds and deploys your application. With this foundation, you can explore advanced features like environment variables, approval gates, and integration with other Azure services.
