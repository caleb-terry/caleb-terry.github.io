# Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Azure

## Introduction

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating your CI/CD pipelines directly from your GitHub repository. This guide will show you how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and deploy your application to Azure.

## Prerequisites

- An active GitHub account
- An active Azure account
- Basic understanding of CI/CD concepts

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository for your application.

## Step 2: Create a Workflow File

1. In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Create a new workflow file (`ci-cd-pipeline.yml`):

   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up .NET Core
           uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
           with:
             dotnet-version: "5.0.x"

         - name: Build project
           run: dotnet build --configuration Release

         - name: Run tests
           run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Login to Azure
           uses: azure/login@v1
           with:
             creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

         - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
           uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
           with:
             app-name: your-app-name
             slot-name: production
             publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
   ```

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Your Azure service principal credentials in JSON format.
   - `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`: Your Azure Web App publish profile.

## Step 4: Push Your Code

1. Commit and push your code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

## Step 5: Monitor the Workflow

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Monitor the progress of your CI/CD pipeline and ensure the build and deployment are successful.

## Summary

By using GitHub Actions, you can automate your CI/CD pipelines and deploy applications to Azure directly from your GitHub repository. This integration streamlines your development workflow and ensures consistent deployments.
